The objectif of this script is to provide an automated process to create a Water Distribution Network WDN, from an existing Network.
The generated WDN contains for each line an end and start ID of the junction. Each junction contains an information about the slope and the altitude
Please specify your own paths to load the DEM and the WDN  and run the process.
